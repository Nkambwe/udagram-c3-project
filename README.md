# Spliting application into Microservices

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree.
 It allows users to register and log into a web client and post photos to the feed.

The project is split into four parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend] (udacity-c3-frontend - A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backends). 
2. [The User Backend](udacity-c3-restapi-user) - Adds a new user to the system
3. [The Feed Backend](udacity-c3-restapi-feed) - Allows user to add personal images
4. [The User Backend](udacity-c3-deploymenet) - deploys the application docker containers and services to the cloud
